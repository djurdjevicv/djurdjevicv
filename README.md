 About me:
 <br/>
As a student of software and information technologies, I am dedicated to developing even more skills and knowledge in the field. As a beginner iOS developer, I have gained experience in frontend development and have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, C#, and Golang. I am a team player and enjoy collaborating with others, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn and take on new challenges. I consider myself to be a curious and friendly person, and believe that these qualities allow me to approach problem-solving with a positive and open-minded attitude. I am excited to continue growing as a developer and contribute to the creation of innovative and user-friendly applications.
